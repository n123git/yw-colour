# yw-colour
Yo-kai Watch uses a special control code format for text - this tool handles Colouring Appearence control codes, it does NOT handle:
* Actor Control Codes
* Game Variable control codes
* Glyphs
This attempts to mimic the exact quirks, feature-set and implementation of the Yo-kai Watch 2 format, down to everye edge case. Made for `yw-mod`.
